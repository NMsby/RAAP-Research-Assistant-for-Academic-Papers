    "This notebook presents a system for helping researchers navigate and understand academic papers. The system can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Answer specific questions about paper content\n",
    "- Generate summaries of papers\n",
    "- Find connections between different papers\n",
    "- Identify research gaps and future directions\n",

    "\n",
    "- There are many papers to read on a topic\n",
    "- Papers use specialized terminology\n",
    "- Connections between papers aren't always clear\n",
    "- Finding specific information requires reading entire papers\n",
